Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

     ```
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```
  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.


- Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

- In GitHub, send a pull request to `maptime.github.io:master`.

That's it, thanks!
